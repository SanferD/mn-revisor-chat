The search results indicate two Minnesota laws that are relevant for construction projects in the North Loop area of Minneapolis: ยง 469.53 authorizes state funding for public infrastructure projects in the Regional Exchange District, which includes the North Loop. Eligible projects include construction, demolition, and site preparation. ยง 337.10, subd. 1, prohibits construction contracts in Minnesota from containing provisions that make the contract subject to the laws of another state.
